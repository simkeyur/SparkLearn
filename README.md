# SparkLearn ✨

**Live Demo:** [**https://simkeyur.github.io/sparklearn**](https://simkeyur.github.io/sparklearn)

SparkLearn is a modern, kid-friendly web app designed to help children learn reading, math, and logic through interactive, AI-powered modules. The app adapts content to the child's age, making learning fun, engaging, and personalized, while keeping all parental controls in a single, secure area.

## Features

- **Simplified Kid's View:** A clean, simple welcome screen where kids select their profile to begin.
- **Centralized Parent Settings:** All administrative tasks are consolidated into a single settings page, accessible via a floating gear icon (⚙️).
- **Robust Profile Management:** From the settings page, parents can easily **Create**, **Edit**, and **Delete** kid profiles.
- **Consistent Parental Gate:** A single, simple math question protects all sensitive actions (accessing settings, editing/deleting profiles, exiting a session).
- **Age-Appropriate Modules:** Reading, Math, and a new **Coding/Logic** module are generated based on specific age ranges (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12).
- **AI-Powered Content:** Uses the Gemini API (BYOK) to generate stories, math problems, and logic puzzles.
- **Interactive Quizzes:** Multiple-choice questions are presented as clean, readable cards with instant feedback and scoring.
- **Modern, Tablet-Friendly UI:** A bright, playful design with emojis and a fully responsive layout.
